# 🔗 Task 5: SQL Joins (Inner, Left, Right, Full)

## 📌 Overview
This task demonstrates how to use different types of **SQL JOINs** to combine and analyze data across multiple tables in the `EcommerceDB`.  
It covers `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, and `FULL OUTER JOIN` with practical use cases from Customers, Orders, Products, and Reviews tables.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Learn how to combine data from related tables  
- Understand the differences between INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, and FULL JOIN  
- Handle missing data using outer joins  
- Write multi-table join queries for real-world reporting  

---

## 🛠️ Features
✅ `INNER JOIN` → Get only matching records (e.g., Customers with Orders)  
✅ `LEFT JOIN` → Retrieve all records from one table, even if no match exists  
✅ `RIGHT JOIN` → Retrieve all records from the second table, even without matches  
✅ `FULL OUTER JOIN` → Combine results from both tables completely  
✅ Multi-table joins to connect Customers → Orders → Products

## 📊 Outcomes
- Ability to merge data from multiple related tables  
- Understand how join types affect results when data is missing  
- Write detailed queries for reports like:  
  - All customers and their orders  
  - Orders with product details  
  - Customers without orders  
  - Products not yet purchased

## 📝 Example Queries
- Get **Orders with Customer info** using `INNER JOIN`  
- List **all Customers and their Orders** using `LEFT JOIN`  
- Show **all Orders including unmatched Customers** using `RIGHT JOIN`  
- Combine **Customers and Orders fully** using `FULL OUTER JOIN`  
- Join **Customers + Orders + Products** for detailed sales reports
